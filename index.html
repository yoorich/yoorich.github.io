<p>I'm really not coolest of the cool. I'm a quirky girl with no filter, enjoy Milano cookies, and love learning. I'm particularly interested in psychology and math. Hence, why I'm a part of SINY's technical marketing track. I'm excited to be in an environment that gives me a glimpse into the creative start-up world. To me, start-ups' are a game changer, slowly but surely, shifting the status quo of Corporate America. As it should! With this program, I hope to gain the right skills under my belt, so that I too, can pay it forward.</p>
